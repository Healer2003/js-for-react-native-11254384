## Project Overview
This project consists of three main tasks implemented in JavaScript. The tasks involve processing arrays of numbers and strings, with the final task creating user profiles based on these arrays.

## Task 1
**File**: `arrayManipulation.js`  
**Function**: `processArray(array)`

**Description**: 
This function takes an array of numbers as an argument and loops through each element in the array. If an element is even, the number is squared. It is tripled if odd. The modified elements are then stored and returned in a new array.

## Task 2 
**File** : `arrayManipulation.js`
**Function**: `formatArrayStrings(strings, proNumbers)`

**Description**:
This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the processArray function. It returns a new array of strings where each string is capitalized if the corresponding number is even, and converted into lowercase if number is odd.

## Task 3
**File**: `userInfo.js`
**Function**: `createUserProfiles(originalName, modifiedName)`

**Description**:
This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of names and an array of its modified form using the function in Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and id which increases automatically, starting from 1.
